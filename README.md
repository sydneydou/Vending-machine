## What is DownLow?

DownLow is a web-based application that allows logged-in users to rsvp to underground events and/or concerts created by other users. Without requiring user authorization in order to create an event, allows for anybody to be an artist, and promote and celebrate their work. Once a user has created an event, they will have the ability to track how many people are interested in their events, and the ability to delete it as well.
